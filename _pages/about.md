I am a PhD student from [School of Computing and Data Science](https://www.cds.hku.hk) at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk), advised by [Prof. Ka-Ho Chow](https://khchow.com). I received my bachelor degree in [Software Engineering](https://sse.tongji.edu.cn) from the [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn), Shanghai, China.

My research interests primarily lie in cybersecurity, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. During my PhD studies, my research objectives will focus on investigating the limitations of existing attack/defense methods and developing more comprehensive approaches to address these security challenges. My research topics encompass backdoor attacks, Deepfake defense, adversarial attacks, and related security issues in machine learning systems.
